## Explore US Bikeshare Data


### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. There were steps conducted through this project including:
- Importing the data 
- Using descriptive statistics to explore insiights. 
- Creating an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
The three city dataset files provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States,  were used in this project:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

Also a template (bikeshare.py file) with guidelines  was adapted to work in this project.
